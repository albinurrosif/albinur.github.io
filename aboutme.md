subtitle: Informatics Engineering | Aspiring Full-Stack Developer
---

I am an enthusiastic recent undergraduate in Informatics Engineering with a solid foundation in full-stack web development. Through academic projects and self-directed learning, I have gained hands-on experience building applications with **Laravel (PHP)** for the backend and am actively expanding my skills into modern frontend development with **JavaScript and React**.

I am seeking an opportunity to contribute to a collaborative team, apply my foundational knowledge, and grow my technical capabilities in a professional environment.

### My Technical Skills

- **Backend:** PHP, Laravel, ExpressJS, MySQL, RESTful APIs
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React (Currently Learning)
- **Tools & Others:** Git, GitHub, VS Code

### My Story

My journey in technology began during my diploma studies, where I discovered a passion for building things that live on the internet. My interest solidified while working on my final project, a task management web application built with Laravel. This experience taught me invaluable lessons about the software development lifecycle, from database design to deployment.

I am now focused on deepening my understanding of modern JavaScript ecosystems and frontend frameworks to become a proficient full-stack developer. I am excited to start my professional career, learn from experienced mentors, and contribute to meaningful projects.
